Dream is a music video done in Ruby with gamebox.  Everything is original, be kind.  :)

If you just want to watch it: [Video on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/116836454)

If you want to play with it or hack on it:

* Install Ruby - `ruby` should work
* `gem install bundler` - if you haven't already
* `git clone https://github.com/squarism/dream`
* `cd dream`
* `brew install sdl2 libogg libvorbis` - get gosu deps installed from homebrew 
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec rake` - to run it (it gets this default task from the gamebox rake tasks)

More info on gamebox is at [gamebox.io](http://gamebox.io).
